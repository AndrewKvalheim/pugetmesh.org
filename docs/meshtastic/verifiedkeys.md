Meshtastic uses a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In an attempt to provide some level of authenticity, we will use this page to capture the public key for verified users. 

## How to Verify
To become verified, I will need to meet you in person and you will need to send me a message with the device you wish to verify.
