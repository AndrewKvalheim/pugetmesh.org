The [Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network](https://www.arednmesh.org/) (AREDN®) mesh provides a way for Amateur Radio operators to create high-speed ad hoc Data Networks for use in Emergency and service-oriented communications. 

Specifially, AREDN is the software that runs on top of consumer and commercial-grade WiFi hardware in place of the factory firmware. This new software takes care of the considerations required to setup and manage a mesh network with no internet and and a focus on Emergency Communications (EmComm). While it is possible to legally use AREDN without a ham radio license, the frequencies and power levels used in the Puget Sound region do require a license. 

## Why AREDN?
AREDN® provides a way for amateur radio operators to create high-speed data networks for use in emergency and community service communication. At a high level, an Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network is simply another tool for your EmComm toolbox. As an amateur radio operator involved in emergency communication, you already have quite a few RF resources that you use on a regular basis. AREDN® is yet another tool that you might want to have available if it meets an important EmComm requirement, which we’ll see in a moment.

If your AREDN node is connected to the internet, it can publish its GPS or manually set position to appear on the [AREDN Mesh Map](http://usercontent.arednmesh.org/K/5/K5DLQ/livemap2.html#9/47.5395/-122.3973). 

Additionally there is an [AREDN offline Map submission tool](https://www.arednmesh.org/content/aredn-offline-map-submit-tool-updated).

## Uses
There are two primary ways to build an AREDN mesh:

1. Proactive (Before being needed)
2. Reactive (After they are needed)

### Proactive
Proactive Mesh networks are setup today, ahead of their need for Emergency Communications. An example would be what is setup today (2024) in West Seattle, and what is found on the AREDN Mesh Map. These networks can grow very large and have connectivity between many links that are very far away via highly directional antennas.


### Reactive
These networks can do everyting a Proactive network can do, but are only set up post-incident. It is safe to assume that natural disasters will impact tradional communications (e.g. Cell towers inoperational) but they will also impact the Proactive mesh networks. Directional antennas may be moved out of alignment, power issues, new line-of-site issues obstructing connectivity, etc. 

An example Reactive mesh network may look like a local park that has become a command center post-incident. With AREDN, multi-agency departments can arrive to the command center, power on their AREDN nodes, and automatically connect to the mesh network. This type of reactive deployment is one of AREDN's strengths. 



It is important to practice both of these deployment types, building out a mesh ahead of an incident, and also practicing setting up impromptu deployments in new and unique locations.
